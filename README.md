# Blender-Shortcuts
Keyboard shortcut listing of common commands used in my Blender tutorials.

**View:**  
* 1 - front view.  
* 3 - side view.  
* 5 - toggle between perspective and orthographic.  
*(Note: you must use the numpad keys for this, not the top row of number keys. If you do not have a numpad, enable 'emulate numpad' in the Input section of the user preferences. This will allow you to use the top row of numbers).*

* H - hide selected *(Alt + H to unhide).*
* Z - toggle wireframe/solid shading.  
* Shift + C - reset 3d cursor to centre of scene.

**Mode:**
* Tab - switch between object and edit mode.  

**Selection:**  
* A - select everything *(unless something is already selected, in which case unselect everything).*
* B + left mouse drag - box selection *(middle mouse drag deselects instead).*
* C + left mouse drag - brush selection tool *(middle mouse drag deselects instead. Use scrollwheel to change brush size).*
* L - selects all vertices joined to the one under the cursor *(hold down Shift to deselect instead).*
* Alt + right click - select edge loop.
  
**Transform:**
* G - move tool.  
* R - rotation tool *(double tap R to enter 'trackball rotation' mode).*
* S - scale tool *(Alt + S to shrink/fatten in edit mode).*  
* While using transform tool, entering a number will allow you to set exact values for the transformation.
* Press X or Y or Z *(while using tool such as grab/rotate/scale)* - constrain the transformation to that axis.  
* Hold down Ctrl - enables snapping.  
* Hold down Shift - allows for smaller adjustments while using tools like move/rotate/scale.  
* Period/fullstop - change pivot to 3d cursor.
* Comma - change pivot to mesh centre *(or object origin in object mode).*
  
**General:**
* X - delete selection. 
* Shift + D - duplicate selection.
* Shift + A - create new mesh/object.
  
**Edit mode:**
* E - extrude selection.
* F - fill face.
* P - separate selected mesh into new object.

* Alt + M - merge selected vertices. 
* Ctrl + R - loopcut tool *(cursor position determines location, orientation of cut. Use scrollwheel to increase/decrease number of cuts).* 

* W - 'specials' menu *(subdivide, remove doubles, shading mode, smooth mesh, etc).*  
* Ctrl + E - edges menu *(edge sliding, and others).* 
* Ctrl + Tab - mesh selection mode *(vertex/edge/face).*
* Ctrl + N - recalculate normals of selected vertices *(use this if your mesh has strange lighting defects).*
If editing bones, this will recalculate the bone roll instead.

**Object mode:**
* Ctrl + J - join two selected objects into single mesh.
* Ctrl + A - apply transformation on selected object.
* Ctrl + P - parent first selected object/s to last selected object.

**Pose mode:**
* Ctrl + C - copy pose of selected bones.
* Shift + Ctrl + V - paste copied pose onto other side of rig.

**Menus:**  
* Spacebar - search bar *(useful for finding tools if you forget the shortcut).*
* N - opens/closes properties panel.  
* T - opens/closes tool shelf.
